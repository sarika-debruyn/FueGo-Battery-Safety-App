# Fuego: E-Mobility Driver Battery Safety App

## About

Prototype MVP developed as part of Columbia University’s Principles of Innovation & Entrepreneurship course and from winning first place at Climate Hackathon: Battery Safety. FueGo is a compliance and incentive platform designed to improve e-bike battery safety, helping drivers, platforms, insurers, and cities reduce fire risks while promoting sustainable urban mobility.

## Problem

- Over 270 e-bike battery fires in NYC in 2024 due to uncertified lithium-ion batteries.
- New regulations mandate UL-certified batteries, but compliance is costly and difficult to track.
- Delivery platforms and insurers face legal, financial, and reputational risks without better solutions.

## Solution

FueGo introduces the first platform-agnostic compliance and incentive system for the e-bike economy:

- Driver Safety Scoring: real-time battery verification with rewards
- Compliance Dashboards: automated tracking for delivery platforms and insurers
- City Integration: connects certified swap hubs with public safety initiatives

## Features

- Real-time battery health monitoring
- Safety score tracking and history
- Battery swap station locator
- Rewards and achievements system
- Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons
- React Router DOM
